# YoloBatchTensorflow
Enabling batch inference in YOLO v3.0 and v4.0 (TensorFlow versions) is a tricky and time-consuming activity. Because the code needs to be changed in several sections, any mistake can lead to wrong or empty results. In this repository, I shared a detect_image_batch for YOLO. It can be used safely.
